# Preliminary information:
In the folder called resources you will find all the csv's used for this project. They consist of information obtained from yahoo finance.
The analysis focuses on the Dow Jones industrial average (DJI). All the stocks that compose the index have been downloaded, as well as the S&P 500
All the files are in the folder called "Resources"

# STEP #1:
Open the notebook called "DataFrame.ipynb" and execute. What this file does is create the necessary DataFrames and then combine the data into a single dataframe with the closing daily prices for the last year.

# STEP #2:
Open the notebook called "Stock_Analysis.ipynb". Here various comparisons are made between the stocks and the indices. The objective is to visualize the best 5 performing stocks in the Dow Jones and how they relate to the market indices.

# STEP #3:
Open the notebook called "Efficient_Frontier.ipynb" to calculate the efficient frontier and the capital market line in order to find the minimum risk portfolio and the optimal risk portfolio based on the 5 best stoks found in Step #2.

# STEP #4:
In this step we find the Beta of each one of the stocks, which is part of the CAPM financial model. We do the same for the entire portfolio. Beta is a way to calculate the expected returns of a stock or a portfolio vs. that of the Market (for which S&P500 is a proxy)
